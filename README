Previously implemented a Photoshop-style color picker using a jQuery plugin written by John Dyer (http://johndyer.name) and converted to MooTools 1.2 by Scott Boyce (http://scottpowered.com) for a site build. Did not have the time to write good code. Now fixing and rewriting the code for MooTools 1.3 as a plugin. I know there are already several color pickers available on the MooTools Forge, but this is mainly an exercise for my own edification.

Requirements:
Mootools Core 1.3 Full
Mootools More 1.3 Color and Slider
